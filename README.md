# Busco

An app for search-and-rescue parties that maintains a shared list of visited GPS coordinates so that teams looking for someone can know not to double up on locations. Featured here are a backend / JSON API built with Node.js, and a frontend viewer that queries the API built with Ajax and the Google Maps API.

We also built an Android app that sends a phone's GPS locations to the server-side list, but it lives on Jill's computer and is not featured here.

Built at Hoya Hacks with @jackbowden and Jill Mao. This won second place in the software track!
